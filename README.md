# SpaceMAX ðŸš€

It's a SpaceX-based iOS app I'm creating for fun while trying out some programming concepts.

## Building the app

Before building the app, you need to run `make setup` on the project's root folder. It'll install the needed dependencies, set up the environment, download the `schema.graphqls` file and generate the GraphQL operation and schema files. After that, you should be good to go.

## Generating GraphQL models

After creating your `.graphql` file containing your query, run `make generate-graphql-code` to generate the referent files.
